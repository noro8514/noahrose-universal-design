          <h2>Why Practice Universal Design?</h2>

          <p>The internet is rapidly expanding, with more and more new users interacting with each other every year. According to the US Census, in 2022 the United States had 313,600,000 internet users, which constituted about 94.6% of the US population. There were also 279,850,000 mobile device users with an expected increase of 41.15 million more users in the next 5 years. Similar upward trends are being observed around the world as we become more and more connected to each other. What is important to note, however, is that with an increasing number of internet users comes an increasing number of people with disabilities that are also interacting with the internet. The US Census also found that in 2022 there were over 44 million people dealing with a disability, which constitutes over 13% of the US population. Breaking this down further, 2.5% of the US population had a vision impairment, 6.7% had a mobility impairment, 3.7% had a hearing impairment, and 5.7% had a learning disability. As the internet continues to grow, we can no longer ignore the needs of those who may require additional accommodations to access the internet in the same way everyone else does. To do so would be to bar great minds from expressing themselves to the world and innovating the future, simply because of a condition out of their control. </p>

          <p>We need to push for Universal Design because the current standard is too low. Websites are hardly ever designed with screen readers in mind or color contrast for those with color blindness. Many websites also struggle with tab navigation, forcing those with mobility impairments to search for information elsewhere. Between these three examples alone, we have already marginalized between 8 and 30 million people in the United States alone, ignoring the disabled populations of the rest of the world that add to this group. Universal Design provides an avenue for all persons to access the internet and absorb the information they need.</p>
