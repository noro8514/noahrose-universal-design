          <h2>What Is Universal Design?</h2>
          <p>Universal Design is the integration of new design practices that accommodate all audiences, including those with disabilities and any form. Websites should be accessible for everybody, and features should be provided for those who may not be able to interpret websites the same way as the rest of us. People with blindness should be able to read the same information anyone else is seeing. People with hearing impairments should be able to receive the same information from audio as everyone else. Those with learning disabilities should have an avenue to express and learn, just like everyone else. Universal Design is the implementation of practices that allow these demographics to access the internet just as efficiently as the rest of us. Not only should accessibility be provided for all users, it should be done in a way that does not feel as if it was plastered on after the website was built. The idea is to create accessible websites that do not feel as if those with disabilities were an afterthought, but rather were considered during the design process.
          </p>

          <p>We can begin understanding Universal Design by discussing Norman's Design Concepts, and how they apply to website design. Donald Norman pioneered the space of accessibility design by laying out some core principles related to creating products and services that are usable by much broader audiences. His five concepts are as follows.

        <h2>Perceived Affordances</h2>
      </aside>
      <aside id="affordDesc">
        <h2 class="sr-only">Description of Perceived Affordance</h2>
        <p>
          The idea of perceived affordance refers to the way products are designed and how these designs should implicitly showcase how a product should be used. What does this mean? Imagine a lever. The way a lever is designed would imply that you would pull it. The long pole and the space beneath it would imply that the lever would rotate, and that’s exactly what it was designed to do. This is an example of a product designed with perceived affordance in mind. A poorly designed lever may require you to push the handle inwards rather than pulling it. Products should be created with their intended use in mind, and the shape it takes should make it obvious how to interact with it. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In websites, this would include putting necessary tags around specific pieces of content, designing with certain paradigms in mind, and creating elements with obvious purposes. For example, you likely should not create blue, underlined text unless you are creating a hyperlink. You also want to wrap your content in specific tags to showcase what that content represents. Navigation links should be wrapped in nav bar tags, footers should be removed from the main content, etc… Everything you design should clearly indicate its purpose.

        <h2>Constraints</h2>
      </aside>
      <aside id="constraintDesc">
        <h2 class="sr-only">Description of Constraints</h2>
        <p>Constraints are the counterpart to affordances. It involves the way we design products to avoid misuse or unwanted practice. For example, computers may hide sensitive or critical files that are required for the computer to run so that the user does not unintentionally delete them, thus permanently damaging the computer. Another example would be the safety switch on firearms, as to prevent users from discharging a firearm accidentally. With websites, we should place proper constraints as to assist users in steering away from unwanted behavior or dangerous activities. For example, placing a pattern constraint on the input of a form prevents users from entering incorrect information or attempting malicious attacks on the system.</p>

      <aside id="Visibility">
        <h2>Visibility</h2>
      </aside>
      <aside id="visibilityDesc">
        <h2 class="sr-only">Description of Visibility</h2>
        <p>
          Visibility is the idea that certain elements of products should contain visuals to help indicate proper use or avoid improper use. The flip side would be hiding certain information from the user that is not actively relevant to them. A website may incorporate a “skip navigation” feature for those using a screen reader, but should hide it from users that do not use a screen reader as it does not apply to them.

      <aside id="Feedback">
        <h2>Feedback</h2>
      </aside>
      <aside id="feedbackDesc">
        <h2 class="sr-only">Description of Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Feedback refers to the idea that the system should respond to user interactions to show the user their actions have effect. A responsive system informs the user when an action may be complete, acknowledges when a user has performed an action, and interacts with the user to ensure that the user has a comfortable experience

      <aside id="Mapping">
        <h2>Mapping</h2>
      </aside>
      <aside id="mappingDesc">
        <h2 class="sr-only">Description of Mapping</h2>
        <p>The last concept, mapping, refers to the placement of products or services so the user can make inferences and decisions about the use of an object. A real world example would be the location of door handles on a car. Their placement would indicate that they likely open the door they are attached to. On a website, this may take the shape of navigation buttons being found in a “nav bar” at the top of the screen, typically where navigation is located.</p>

        <h2>WCAG</h2>
        <p>Norman’s Design Concepts, along with legal guidelines, allow developers to create products that hold all users in mind, not just the majority of users. Legal guidelines such as <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 were put in place to guide developers to the creation of better websites. <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> provides a long list of guidelines and features that developers should or need to follow to create accessible and appropriate websites. These guidelines are divided into 5 sections which include perceivable, operable, understandable, robust, and conformance. Each guideline is classified as A, AA, or AAA, which indicate the level of accessibility the guideline provides. Websites are required to meet AA standards, but should strive to achieve AAA standards wherever possible. </p>
