            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Insanity, madness, lunacy, and craziness</strong> are behaviors caused by certain abnormal mental or behavioral patterns. Insanity can manifest as violations of societal norms, including a person or persons becoming a danger to themselves or to other people. Conceptually, mental insanity also is associated with the biological phenomenon of contagion (that mental illness is infectious) as in the case of copycat suicides. In contemporary usage, the term <em>insanity</em> is an informal, un-scientific term denoting "mental instability"; thus, the term insanity defense is the legal definition of mental instability. In medicine, the general term psychosis is used to include the presence of delusions and/or hallucinations in a patient; and psychiatric illness is "psychopathology", not <em>mental insanity</em>.</p>
            
            <p>In English, the word "sane" derives from the Latin adjective <em>sanus</em>, meaning "healthy". Juvenal's phrase <em>mens sana in corpore sano</em> is often translated to mean a "healthy mind in a healthy body". From this perspective, insanity can be considered as poor health of the mind, not necessarily of the brain as an organ (although that can affect mental health), but rather refers to defective function of mental processes such as reasoning. Another Latin phrase related to our current concept of sanity is <em>compos mentis</em> ("sound of mind"), and a euphemistic term for insanity is <em>non compos mentis</em>. In law, <em>mens rea</em> means having had criminal intent, or a guilty mind, when the act (<em>actus reus</em>) was committed.</p>

            <p>A more informal use of the term insanity is to denote something or someone considered highly unique, passionate or extreme, including in a positive sense. The term may also be used as an attempt to discredit or criticize particular ideas, beliefs, principles, desires, personal feelings, attitudes, or their proponents, such as in politics and religion.</p>
            
            <h2>History and Treatment</h2>
            <p>Madness, the non-legal word for insanity, has been recognized throughout history in every known society. Some traditional cultures have turned to witch doctors or shamans to apply magic, herbal mixtures, or folk medicine to rid deranged persons of evil spirits or bizarre behavior, for example. Archaeologists have unearthed skulls (at least 7000 years old) that have small, round holes bored in them using flint tools. It has been conjectured that the subjects may have been thought to have been possessed by spirits that the holes would allow to escape. More recent research on the historical practice of trepanning supports the hypothesis that this procedure was medical in nature and intended as means of treating cranial trauma.</p>

          <h2>Breaking News</h2>
          <p>In an act of laziness, the author of the website has suddenly stopped copying and pasting paragraphs from the Wikipedia article covering insanity. Sources claim that the author himself fell into insanity in the midst of creating the website, and grew so incredibly bored that he stopped as soon as the website became scrollable. It appears as if the title of the article was very fitting, as the act of copying and pasting Wikipedia articles was found to be monotonous and boring, likely leading to the development of this aside section. Experts in the field claim that any further copying and pasting would have led to very few changes outside of raw paragraph tags, and that viewers should not be concerned with any interesting content that may have been missed by this act of laziness.</p>

          <p>In a bold attempt to spice things up, the author of this article has decided to change the layout of the main article and the two asides, thinking that it would be more visually pleasing. Will this bold action lead to substantial results? More on that at 10. </p>
