          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name is Noah, and I am a Game Developer and a Computer Scientist from the University of Colorado Boulder. I graduated with a Bachelors in both Computer Science and Creative Technology and Design. My dream is to be able to make games that leave a lasting impression on people, and also develop games that tell deep and compelling stories. In my free time, you would be hard-pressed to find me doing anything other than playing video games, but I also enjoy making music and skiing! My favorite video game is Final Fantasy XIV.</p>
        
          <p>Throughout my time at <abbr title = "University of Colorado Boulder">UCB</abbr>, I've honed my skills in a variety of programming languages and creative applications. I frequently find myself using Python or C++ for my coding work, and Godot 4 or Ableton Live for my creative work. My time in Boulder has also allowed me to hone my leadership skills and emotional intelligence so that I can be a productive member of any team.</p>

        <h2>Creative Technology and Design</h2>
        <p><abbr title="Creative Technology and Design">CTD</abbr> is likely to be the lesser known of my two majors. CTD as I see it is a major that develops skills revolving around creative practices and technologies that would be difficult to be replaced by AI in the near future. Classes in CTD helped me develop skills in Ableton Live, Unity, HTML/CSS/JS, Godot 4, Physical Computing, and a wide variety of Adobe Products. CTD is the major that has allowed me to express myself through video game development, and help me create stunning assets to accompany them. </p>

        <h2>Computer Science</h2>
        <p>The more widely known and popular of my two majors, Computer Science has allowed me to advance my knowledge in software development. From crucial algorithms, to commonly used data structures, to best practices in Object Oriented Programming, I have cemented my knowledge in all things software. Computer Science has helped me develop skills in Python, C++, Java, Scala, SQL, and a wide variety of commonly used Computer Science applications ranging from Docker to Render to GitHub.</p>
